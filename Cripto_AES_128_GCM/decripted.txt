In addition you can (optionally) provide some Additional Authenticated Data (AAD). The AAD data is not encrypted, and is typically passed to the recipient in plaintext along with the ciphertext. An example of AAD is the IP address and port number in a IP header used with IPsec.

The output from the encryption operation will be the ciphertext, and a tag. The tag is subsequently used during the decryption operation to ensure that the ciphertext and AAD have not been tampered with.
